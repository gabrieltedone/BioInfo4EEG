# change directory
cd [PATH] 

# You will use the above command together with PATHS (where you want to go) to move around the 
# file system structure.

# What is a PATH? 
# A PATH is a variable that indicates the file's location within the entire file structure of the system
# There are ABSOLUTE (starting at the root / ) i.e:         "/user/home/"
# and RELATIVE (relative to the working directory . ) i.e:      "./data/raw/

# _ _ EXAMPLE _ _  #
# Let's say you have some raw sequences (.fastq) you want to quality filter, with commands like fastqc or multiqc.
# You have to move to the directory containing those raw .fastq files.

    1) Where are you located within the directory structure?
pwd
# [OUTPUT] #    /home/ecosystems/Bioinformatics/Classes/BioInfo4EEG

    2) What is the directory structure? Where are the files you want to access?
tree -L 3 (see # [OUTPUT] #  above)

    3) Move to that folder to perform and excecute the commands
cd ./Your_Project_Folder/02_data/01_raw

# You can now excecute fastqc and multiqc commands on .fastq files in the raw data folder

# Performance and computational resources
# Some steps in the primary bioinformatic processing of sequencing reads are quite demanding in terms of
# memory and cpu usage. It can be usefull to observe the status of computational resources using:
